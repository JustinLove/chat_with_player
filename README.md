# Chat With Player

Easily start a private chat with player in current game.

Adds an icon to player names in the players panel which opens the private chat interface.  It's only possible to look up a player by display name if you already know them, but the vanilla PA lobby adds a contact for players in the game, so it should work in this case.

**Important note**: by default the social/uberbar is closed and does not open or notify the player when he receives a message.  This mod has appropriated the PA-Chat highlight effect to the social toggle button for your own use.

Also provides support for mods (e.g. Puppetmaster) to send chat messages to players.
